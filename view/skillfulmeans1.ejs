        <p>Each living being in the universe expresses its true nature in the proces of living. Working is the natural
            human response to being alive, our way of participating in the universe. Work allows us to make full use of
            our potential, to open to the infinite range of experience which lies within even the most mundane activity.
            Through work we can learn to use our energy wisely so that all of our actions are fruitful and rich.</p>
        <p> It is our nature as human beings to be satisfied and fulfilled. Work gives us the opertunity to realize this
            satisfaction by developing the true qualities of our nature. Work is the skillful expression of our total
            being, our means to create harmony and balance within ourselves and in the world. Through work we contribute
            our energy to life, investing our body, our breath and our mind in creative activity. By exercising our
            creativity we fulfill our natural role in life and inspire all beings with the joy of vital participation
